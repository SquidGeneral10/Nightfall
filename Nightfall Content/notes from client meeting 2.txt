try and implement a momentum mechanic so you get faster when
something is picked up

a UI meter can be visible, but it's not necessary.
(i think it would be cool though.)

Alternate enemy - we originally said security camera,
but a larger / faster enemy would also work fine.

he was happy with my prototype,
just needs the proper assets.

Apparently I should move the game score outside of the
gamestate for it to track between levels.

we are thinking of adding multiple
gamestates per level
(e.g outside of ship, inside corridor, captains room)
(e.g art gallery part 1, part 2, safe room)

This would probably be possible by removing the 'you win'
screen between levels

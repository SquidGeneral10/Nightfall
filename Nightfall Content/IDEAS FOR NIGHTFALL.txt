use the monogame guy's guide you already have

use his 'powerup' tutorial that kills enemies
to have a 'slide' pickup
that plays the slide animation
and.. kills enemies

maybe it'll be janky, maybe it won't

also use the portal tutorial that Sam put up a while back
to transfer between gamestates
or something.

i hope finley understands my code lmao
